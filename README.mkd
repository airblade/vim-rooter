# Rooter

Rooter is a Vim plugin which changes the working directory to the project root
when you open a file.

More accurately, it'll do this when you open a typical webapp file.  These files
are identified by their extension.

The project root is identified by the presence of known directory, such as a VCS
directory, or file, such as a Rakefile.  Currently git, darcs, mercurial, bazaar,
and subversion are supported.


## Use

By default you don't need to do anything: vim-rooter will change the working
directory automatically.

You can always invoke vim-rooter manually with `<Leader>cd`.


## Configuration

You can change the manual-invocation mapping by adding this to your `.vimrc`:

    map <silent> <unique> <Leader>foo <Plug>RooterChangeToRootDirectory

where `<Leader>foo` is the mapping you want.

You can change the file extensions which trigger vim-rooter with autocommands
in `~/.vim/after/plugin/vim-rooter.vim`.  You'll need to create this file, and
possibly the directories, yourself.

To add a file extension, e.g. foo:

    autocmd rooter BufEnter *.foo :Rooter

To remove a file extension, e.g. js:

    autocmd! rooter BufEnter *.js

To stop vim-rooter changing directory automatically, add this to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:rooter_manual_only = 1

You can set your own directory and file patterns like this:

    let g:rooter_patterns = ['Rakefile', '.git/']

Note this overwrites the default patterns.  Also note directories should have
a trailing slash.

Finally you can have vim-rooter locally change directory (`:lcd`) instead of
changing directory (`:cd`) by adding this to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:rooter_use_lcd = 1


## Installation

Install into `~/.vim/plugin/rooter.vim` or, if you're using Pathogen, into
`~/.vim/bundle/rooter.vim`.
