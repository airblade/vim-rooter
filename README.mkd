# Rooter

Rooter is a Vim plugin which changes the working directory to the project root
when you open a file.

The project root is identified by the presence of known directory, such as a VCS
directory, or file, such as a Rakefile. Out of the box it looks for git, darcs,
mercurial, bazaar, and subversion, but you can configure it to look for anything
you like.


## Use

By default you don't need to do anything: vim-rooter will change the working
directory automatically and echo the new working directory.

You can always invoke vim-rooter manually with `<Leader>cd`.


## Configuration

You can change the manual-invocation mapping by adding this to your `.vimrc`:

    map <silent> <unique> <Leader>foo <Plug>RooterChangeToRootDirectory

where `<Leader>foo` is the mapping you want.

To prevent vim-rooter from creating a mapping, do this:

    let g:rooter_disable_map = 1

By default all files trigger vim-rooter. You can restrict the files by passing a comma separated list of extensions like this:

    let g:rooter_autocmd_patterns = '*.rb,*.haml,*.js'

To stop vim-rooter changing directory automatically, add this to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:rooter_manual_only = 1

You can set your own directory and file patterns like this:

    let g:rooter_patterns = ['Rakefile', '.git/']

Vim-rooter checks the patterns depth-first in the order given. So to work correctly with git submodules you should have `.git` before `.git/`. All directories should have a trailing slash.

Setting your own patterns overwrites the defaults. You can use

    let g:rooter_patterns = g:rooter_patterns + [ 'foo' ]

to append to the default patterns.

You can have vim-rooter locally change directory (`:lcd`) instead of
changing directory (`:cd`) by adding this to your `.vimrc`:

    let g:rooter_use_lcd = 1

When vim-rooter encounters a non-project file, it won't change directory by default.
If you would instead like vim-rooter to change to the file's directory, do this:

    let g:rooter_change_directory_for_non_project_files = 1

This makes vim-rooter behave similarly to `autochdir` for non-project files.

If you don't want vim-rooter to echo the project directory, try this:

    let g:rooter_silent_chdir = 1

## Installation

Install into `~/.vim/plugin/rooter.vim` or, if you're using Pathogen, into
`~/.vim/bundle/rooter.vim`.
