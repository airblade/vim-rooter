Introduction                                    *rooter* *rooter-introduction*

Rooter is a Vim plugin which changes the working directory to the project root
when you open a file.

The project root is identified by the presence of known directory, such as a
VCS directory, or file, such as a Rakefile. Out of the box it looks for git,
darcs, mercurial, bazaar, and subversion, but you can configure it to look for
anything you like.

==============================================================================
Use                                                               *rooter-use*

By default you don't need to do anything: vim-rooter will change the working
directory automatically and echo the new working directory.

vim-rooter will unset |&autochdir| if it's set because the plugin supersedes
the option's functionality.

You can always invoke vim-rooter manually with |<Leader>cd|.

==============================================================================
Using root-finding functionality in other scripts        *rooter-finding-root*

The public function |FindRootDirectory()| returns the absolute path to the
root directory as a string, if a root directory is found, or an empty string
otherwise.

If that's all you need from this plugin, you can turn off the rest of its
behaviour like this: >

    let g:rooter_manual_only = 1
    let g:rooter_disable_map = 1
<

==============================================================================
Configuration                                           *rooter-configuration*
                                                        *g:rooter_manual_only*
                                                        *g:rooter_disable_map*
                                                           *g:rooter_patterns*
                                                   *g:rooter_autocmd_patterns*
                                                            *g:rooter_use_lcd*
                             *g:rooter_change_directory_for_non_project_files*
                                                     *g:rooter_chdir_makefile*

You can change the manual-invocation mapping by adding this to your |vimrc|: >

    map <silent> <unique> <Leader>foo <Plug>RooterChangeToRootDirectory
<
where <Leader>foo is the mapping you want.

To prevent vim-rooter from creating a mapping, do this: >

    let g:rooter_disable_map = 1
<
By default all files trigger vim-rooter. You can restrict the files by passing
a comma separated list of extensions, like this:
>
    let g:rooter_autocmd_patterns = '*.rb,*.haml,*.js'
<
To stop vim-rooter changing directory automatically, add this to your |vimrc|: >

    let g:rooter_manual_only = 1
<
You can set your own directory and file patterns like this: >

    let g:rooter_patterns = ['Rakefile', '.git/']
<
Vim-rooter checks the patterns depth-first in the order given. So to work
correctly with git submodules you should have '.git' before '.git/'. All
directories should have a trailing slash.

Setting your own patterns overwrites the defaults. You can use >

    let g:rooter_patterns = g:rooter_patterns + [ 'foo' ]
<
to append to the default patterns.

You can have vim-rooter locally change directory (|:lcd|) instead of changing
directory (|:cd|) by adding this to your .vimrc: >

    let g:rooter_use_lcd = 1
<
When vim-rooter encounters a non-project file, it won't change directory by
default. If you would instead like vim-rooter to change to the file's
directory, do this: >

    let g:rooter_change_directory_for_non_project_files = 1
<
This makes vim-rooter behave similarly to 'autochdir' for non-project files. >
<
If you don't want vim-rooter to echo the project directory, try this: >

    let g:rooter_silent_chdir = 1
<
By default, vim-rooter doesn't resolve symbolic links, so it will look for the
project root from a link's location. If you want it to look from the location
of a link's target instead, you can use: >

    let g:rooter_resolve_links = 1
<
If you want vim-rooter to not change to your root-directory but instead change
to the first directory in your path containing a Makefile, you can use: >

    let g:rooter_chdir_makefile = 1
<
Specifying your own Makefile formats overwrites the defaults. You can use >

    let g:rooter_patterns = g:rooter_makefile_patterns + [ 'hello.mk' ]
<
to append to the default patterns for makefile scripts.
